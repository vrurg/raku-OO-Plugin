=head3 class C<PluginMessage>

This class is used to provide a plugin with information about the current call. In its pure form the plugin manager is
using objects of this class to communicate with callbacks.

=end pod
class PluginMessage is export {
    #| Parameters the method has been called with
    has Capture:D $.params is rw is required;
    #| Data only available to a single plugin. This data would exists strictly within one execution chain and won't be
    #| exposed to the code from other plugins.
    has $.private is rw;
    #| Data shared among all the plugins. This attribute is similar to .private except this data is shared; i.e. what is
    #| set by one plugin can be read or changed by others.
    has %.shared;
    # Plugin-suggested return value
    has $!rc;
    # Indicates that $!rc was set.
    has Bool:D $!rc-set = False;

    #| This method sets the suggested return value for the current execution chain.
    method set-rc ( $!rc is copy --> Nil ) {
        $!rc-set = True;
    }

    #| Reset the suggested return value.
    method reset-rc ( --> Nil ) {
        $!rc = Nil;
        $!rc-set = False;
    }

    #| Returns _True_ if the suggested return value has been set.
    method has-rc ( --> Bool ) { $!rc-set }

    #| Suggested return value
    method rc { $!rc }
}

=head3 class C<MethodHandlerMsg>

Inherits from C<PluginMessage>. Used to provide information for method handlers.

=end pod

    #| Instance of the object the original method has been called upon.
    has Any:D $.object is required;
    #| Name of the method being called.

The base class of all plugins.
